# Competitive
This repository is solely for sharing problems, solutions, and tips from the Competitive Programming group created by PucPR students.

If you are a PucPR student and part of this group, you have already received an invitation to join this repository. Everyone will have the right to make any commits. This is a study group, and making mistakes is part of the learning process. However, you must remember that the mistakes will be yours, and it will be your responsibility to correct any errors you make.

We will use a directory for each phase. Finally, note that, for now, I am creating a Visual Studio Community Edition project for each possible solution, naming the solution followed by the problem number. For example: inocente-1. You can create a subdirectory with your solutions, your proposals, and anything you want to post. Just don't forget that this directory must have your name, and in this directory, you should include a README file with your GitHub username and a brief curriculum.
