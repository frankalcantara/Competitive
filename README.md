# Competitive Programming PucPR - Students

This repository is solely for sharing problems, solutions, and tips from the Competitive Programming group created by PucPR students.

If you are a PucPR student and part of this group, you have already received an invitation to join this repository. Everyone will have the right to make any commits. This is a study group, and making mistakes is part of the learning process. However, you must remember that the mistakes will be yours, and it will be your responsibility to correct any errors you make.

We will create a Visual Studio solution for each phase. For each phase, there will be a separate project for every version of the code containing the solution. The projects will be named accordingly to reflect the different versions. For example: inocente-1. Additionally, we will create a directory for each problem, and within this directory, students can create their own subdirectories with their solutions, following the rules already mentioned. Each student directory must contain their name, and inside it, they should include a README file with their GitHub username and a brief curriculum.

You can also create a subdirectory with your solutions, your proposals, and anything you want to post. Just don't forget that this directory must have your name, and the README file with your GitHub username and a brief curriculum must also be included.
